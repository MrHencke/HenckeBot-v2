<h1> HenckeBot-v2: Electric Boogaloo</h1>
<h2>About</h2>
<p>Henckebot is a personal project of mine, it is one of my first personal projects with an organic growth cycle, where the bounds of the bot has grown depending on needs and suggestions from friends and users.
It is poorly documented, but managed in a series of modules, so it retains readability to an alright extent.</p>

<p>The project is going public and archived on 24.09.2020, reason being i stopped development in june of 2020, and have pretty much reached every goal i had with the project.</p>

Long live henckebot may 2020 - june 2020
